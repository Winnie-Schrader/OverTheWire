-size: This is the option in the find command that allows you to specify the size of the files you're looking for.

1033: This is the exact size in units you want to search for. In this context, it specifies the number of bytes.

c: This suffix indicates that the size is in bytes (characters). The c stands for "characters," but in the context of find, it is equivalent to bytes.
